IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application helps you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.   
We are in the transition phase of our networks' address structure from IPv4 to IPv6, and I believe that   
the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error.   
For this purpose, I wrote and distributed IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool both with C# and Java JDK based frameworks.    
This application requires installation and does not modify any registry, only creates XML file for last settings.   
I distributed the application in the hope that it will be useful for your subnet calculations.   
I will try to develop the software continuously, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or new feature suggestions.
