IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool

Latest Version: v3.9

IPv6 Subnet Calculator / Tool application lets you plan/subnet your assigned address for all 128 bits.   
We are in the transition phase of our networks' addressing structure from IPv4 to IPv6, and I believe that the network engineers should easily plan their IPv6 addressing /subnetting infrastructure without any error. For this purpose, I wrote and distributed a free IPv6 Subnetting Tool / Calculator both with C# and Java JDK 1.8 based on JavaFX Application Frameworks.    
This application requires no installation and does not modify any registry or create any file.
I distributed the application in the hope that it will be useful for your subnet calculations.
I will try to develop the software continuously, so please don't hesitate to comment/inform for any bugs or new feature suggestions.
